        Hi, I'm Robert, and I have a passion for the milling industry, working primarily as a Miller,

        I love what I do. 
        The life outside of work is important to me.
        I believe in balancing hard work with quality time spent with loved ones and pursuing personal interests. <br>

    Personal Passions. <br> 
    Dogs, Not Cats: I’m a dog lover at heart. While cats aren’t my thing, my dogs have always been a big part of my life.
    
    I had a beloved dog who passed away in 2023, and he holds a special place in my heart.
    Now, I have a new furry friend, just 6 months old, and she’s already part of the family.
    Home Life: I love spending time at home, especially in my beautiful home with a swimming pool. It’s my favorite place to relax and unwind.
    
    Family Time: Whether it’s hosting BBQs or enjoying a good dinner out, I cherish spending quality time with my loved ones.
